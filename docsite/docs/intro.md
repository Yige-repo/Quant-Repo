# Quant Knowledge Base

Welcome to my personal knowledge system for Quant Finance, Risk Analytics, and Modeling.

This space is built for **my own learning**, structured around four major areas:

---

## 📘 1. Financial Instruments
Understanding instruments and cashflow structures:
- Bonds
- Swaps
- Options
- Structured notes

---

## 🧠 2. Quant Models
Pricing and stochastic process foundations:
- Yield curve & discounting
- Hull-White model
- Monte Carlo simulation
- Stochastic processes

---

## 📉 3. Risk Measures
How risk is quantified and measured:
- VaR, ES
- PFE, CVA, EE/EPE
- Greeks & sensitivities

---

## ⚙️ 4. CrossAsset Mapping
Connecting theory with real system implementations:
- Curve Object
- Exposure Engine
- Simulation Config
- Risk Factor Mapping

---

> 💡 This is not a public wiki. It's a **personal thinking space** to grow knowledge, organize understanding, and connect theory with practice.
