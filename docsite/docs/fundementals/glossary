# Quant Glossary

A growing list of essential terms in fixed income, derivatives, and quantitative finance.  
All definitions are simplified but precise, meant for fast recall and interview use.

---

## 1. Discount Factor (DF)

Present value of receiving 1 unit of currency at time \(T\).

$$
DF(0,T) = e^{-R(0,T)T}
$$

DF is the foundational object for all pricing.

---

## 2. Zero Rate

The continuously compounded rate that corresponds to a discount factor:

$$
R(0,T) = -\frac{1}{T} \ln(DF(0,T))
$$

Represents an *average* rate from now to maturity.

---

## 3. Forward Rate

The implied rate between two future times:

$$
f(T_1,T_2) = -\frac{1}{T_2-T_1} 
\ln\!\left(\frac{DF(0,T_2)}{DF(0,T_1)}\right)
$$

Represents a *future instantaneous rate* implied by today’s curve.

---

## 4. Par

“Equal to face value”; no premium, no discount.

- Bond par = price = 100  
- Swap par rate = fixed leg PV = floating leg PV  
- FRN resets to par each period  

Par instruments are used for bootstrapping.

---

## 5. Bootstrapping

The method of constructing discount factors from market par instruments:

1. Deposits → short-end DF  
2. Futures/FRAs → mid-end DF  
3. Swaps → long-end DF  

Builds the curve point-by-point without arbitrage.

---

## 6. Quote vs Price

**Quote:** Market’s communication format（yield, swap rate, CDS spread…）  
**Price:** Actual monetary value（PV or dirty price）

Quotes are often *not* prices.

---

## 7. Simple Interest

Market convention for deposits and floating rates:

$$
DF=\frac{1}{1+r\Delta}
$$

No compounding.

---

## 8. Continuous Compounding

Quant model convention for zero/forward rates:

$$
DF=e^{-RT}
$$

Used because it supports smooth derivatives and modeling.

---

## 9. Yield to Maturity (YTM)

Single discount rate that sets bond PV equal to price.

Not used for pricing in quant.  
Used only to quote bond value.

---

## 10. Accrual (Daycount Fraction)

The fraction of a year that determines coupon size:

$$
\text{Coupon} = r \cdot \Delta \cdot \text{Notional}
$$

Typical daycounts: ACT/360、ACT/365、30/360.

---

## 11. Clean Price vs Dirty Price

- **Clean price**: quoted price（不含应计利息）  
- **Dirty price**: true cash paid = clean price + accrued interest  

Bond settlement uses dirty price.

---

## 12. Forward Premium / Discount

In FX:  
- Forward > spot → premium  
- Forward < spot → discount  

Driven by interest rate differentials.

---

## 13. Fair Value (PV=0)

A derivative’s fair price is the value that makes its PV = 0 at inception.  
Examples：par swap、par CDS、par FRA。

---

## 14. Floating Leg (Swap)

Always priced at par right after reset:

$$
PV_{\text{float}} = 1
$$

This makes swap bootstrapping possible.

---

## 15. Duration / DV01 (to be expanded)

- Duration: sensitivity to parallel rate shift  
- DV01: price change from a 1 bp change in rates
