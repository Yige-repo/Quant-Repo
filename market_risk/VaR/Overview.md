# Value at Risk (VaR) – Overview

## 1. What is VaR?

- Informal definition
- Why institutions care about VaR
- Typical use cases (limits, capital, backtesting)

## 2. Key VaR Models

- Historical Simulation VaR (HVaR)
- Monte Carlo VaR (MC VaR)
- Parametric / Variance–Covariance VaR

## 3. Inputs & Assumptions

- Portfolio PnL / returns
- Risk factors
- Confidence level (e.g. 95%, 99%)
- Holding period

## 4. Basic Mathematical Definition

- Loss quantile idea
- Notation you want to use later in Python demo

## 5. Pros / Cons

- Pros: intuitive, widely used, regulatory context
- Cons: tail risk, model risk, parameter choices

## 6. Links to Practice

- How HVaR is implemented in systems (e.g. scenario PnL vector)
- Where you see VaR in daily work / products
