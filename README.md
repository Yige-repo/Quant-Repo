# Quant Repo

Personal learning repo for risk modeling and quantitative finance.

Goals:
- Build a structured knowledge base for market risk and counterparty risk
- Implement simple risk models in Python (e.g. VaR, PFE, CVA)
- Connect theory with practical tools (e.g. Numerix / CrossAsset)
- Prepare interview-ready stories and examples

## Structure

- `market_risk/` — VaR, ES, Greeks, sensitivities
- `counterparty_risk/` — PFE, EE/EPE, CVA, SACCR, XVA
- `pricing_models/` — Black-Scholes, Hull-White, LMM, etc.
- `python_lab/` — small Python experiments and demos
- `crossasset_notes/` — notes from working with CrossAsset / risk engine
- `interview_story_repo/` — work/learning stories for interviews
